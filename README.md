# Practical Application III: Comparing Classifiers

## Introduction 
In this practical application, my goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. I utilized a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone. The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository link. The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns. 

## 1: Understanding the Data
The dataset contains: 
bank-additional-full.csv → the main dataset (41,188 rows, 20 features + target y)
bank-additional.csv → a 10% sample of the above
bank-additional-names.txt → the description file with attribute details

The dataset collected is related to 17 marketing campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010, corresponding to a total of 79354 contacts. During these phone campaigns, an attractive long-term deposit application, with good interest rates, was offered.
